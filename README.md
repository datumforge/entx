# entx

A helper package for working with ent(https://entgo.io/). Today this package includes a few utilities:

- Mixin used for assigning a different ID type than the one generated by `ent`
- Mixin used for assigning some default columns (`created_at`, `created_by`, etc. - check out the `mixin` directory for more details)
- A vanilla, drop-in, setup for using `ent` with our standard tool chains `gqlgen`, `gqlgenc`, and some other helpers
- Softdelete extension with cascade delete functionality added in
- Multi-driver support
- SQLite connection interface management
